	<h1>Connection Methods</h1>

	<p>
	There are two ways to connect to the TCB: directly with a Micro-B USB cable, or via Bluetooth using an adapter on the Serial 1 connector. Dipswitch #5 on the TCB determines which port it will
    attempt to communicate over: if Dipswitch #5 is in the On position, it will communicate over USB; if Off then communication will take place over the Serial 1 port.
	</p>

	<h2>USB Drivers - For Direct Connection</h2>
	
	<p>
	The TCB uses a genuine FTDI brand USB chip for direct connection to the computer via USB cable. The drivers you need are the <b>FTDI Virtual COM Port (VCP)</b>
	drivers. These can be downloaded for free from FTDI. 
	</p>

    <p>For links to the drivers and step-by-step instructions with photos, please see the <a href="http://www.openpanzer.org/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:opconfig:gs:drivers">Open Panzer Wiki - USB Drivers</a> page.</p>
	
	<h2>Bluetooth Drivers - for Wireless Connection</h2>
	
	<p>
    Windows already includes the necessary Bluetooth drivers so nothing needs to be installed. 
    However Windows will need to pair with the device, see the <a href="http://openpanzer.org/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:tcb:tcbinstall:bluetooth">Open Panzer Wiki - Bluetooth</a>
    page for more information on this process, as well as links to the recommended Bluetooth adapter compatible with the TCB.
