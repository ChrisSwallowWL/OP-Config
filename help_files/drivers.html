	<h1>Connection Methods</h1>

	<p>
	There are two ways to connect to the TCB: directly with a Micro-B USB cable, or via Bluetooth using an approved adapter. When connected directly with a cable, OP Config is able
	to update the TCB's settings <em>as well as</em> flash new firmware. When connected via Bluetooth, OP Config can <em>only</em> update settings, it can not re-flash the chip. <br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Note 1:</b> Because software and internet links change over time, the instructions below are generic. For specific and up-to-date information on the drivers required,
	please see the <a href="http://openpanzer.org/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:configurator:drivers">Open Panzer Wiki - USB Drivers</a> page.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Note 2:</b> The following instructions are for Windows only (XP/7/8/10).
	</p>
	

	<h2>USB Drivers - For Direct Connection</h2>
	
	<p>
	The TCB uses a genuine FTDI brand USB chip for direct connection to the computer via USB cable. The drivers you need are the <b>FTDI Virtual COM Port (VCP)</b>
	drivers. These can be downloaded for free from FTDI:<br>
	<a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI website</a>.<br><br>
	
	Save the drivers to your hard drive, then plug the TCB into an open USB port on your computer. 
	If you do not already have the drivers installed on your computer, Windows will notify you that it has <b>Found New Hardware</b>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A Wizard should appear asking you where to look for the correct software. Instead of letting Windows connect to the internet to search for drivers, tell Windows you are 
	going to install the drivers "from a specific location" and then, when given the option, browse to and select the folder where you saved the FTDI drivers you downloaded. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After installing the drivers for what Windows will probably call the "FT232R USB UART," you may see Windows try a second installation immediately after for a "USB Serial Port."
	If so, follow the same procedure as before - tell Windows not to connect to the internet for updates, and show it the same folder where you saved the downloaded drivers. 
	Windows may take what seems like an eternity to actually install them. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When the drivers are installed, Windows may ask you to reboot your computer; if so, you should probably Obey. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Finally, after the drivers are installed, a new COM (communication) port should have been added to your computer. Windows will assign it a name like "COM 5" but the number could be
	anything. One way to confirm whether the driver is working is to open the OP Config program <i>without</i> the TCB connected to the computer. Take a note of the COM ports
	shown in the <b>COM Port List</b> (item #4 on the <a href="formlayout.html">Program Layout</a> diagram). Whatever COM port numbers are listed you know do not belong to the TCB
	because the TCB is unplugged. Now, connect the TCB to your computer with a USB cable. Refresh the COM port list with the <b>COM Refresh</b> button 
	(#3 on the <a href="formlayout.html">Program Layout</a> diagram). Now inspect the list of COM ports - a new number should have been detected, and if so, that will be the COM port that 
	Windows assigned to your TCB. If the list remains the same, then the drivers were not installed correctly.	</p>
	
	<p>
	The other method to identify which COM port Windows has assigned to your device is to go to the <b>Device Manager</b> (From the <b>Start Menu</b>, search for "Device Manager").
	Look for an entry under <b>Ports (COM &amp; LPT)</b> that says <b>USB Serial Port (COM)</b>. Again, the actual COM number will vary. As you plug or unplug devices into your computer, 
	Windows will update the list of COM ports, allowing you to identify which number has been assigned to your TCB.
	</p>

	<p>
	Note also if you own multiple TCBs, Windows will assign different numbers to each one. Windows may also ask you to re-install drivers for each TCB individually. 
	</p>

	<h2>Bluetooth Drivers - for Wireless Connection</h2>
	
	<p>
	Windows already includes the necessary Bluetooth drivers if you use the Open Panzer recommended Bluetooth device, so nothing needs to be installed. 
	See the <a href="http://openpanzer.org/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:tcb:tcbinstall:bluetooth">Open Panzer Wiki - Bluetooth</a> page for more information on the recommended adapters
	and how to set them up.
