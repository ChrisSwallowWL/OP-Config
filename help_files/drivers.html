	<h1>Connection Methods</h1>

	<p>
	There are two ways to connect to the TCB: directly with a Micro-B USB cable, or via Bluetooth using an approved adapter. When connected directly with a cable, OP Config is able
	to update the TCB's settings <em>as well as</em> flash new firmware. When connected via Bluetooth, OP Config can <em>only</em> update settings, it can not re-flash the chip. <br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Note 1:</b> Because software and internet links change over time, the instructions below are generic. For specific and up-to-date information on the drivers required,
	please see the <a href="http://openpanzer.org/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:opconfig:gs:drivers">Open Panzer Wiki - USB Drivers</a> page.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Note 2:</b> The following instructions are for Windows only (XP/7/8/10).
	</p>
	

	<h2>USB Drivers - For Direct Connection</h2>
	
	<p>
	The TCB uses a genuine FTDI brand USB chip for direct connection to the computer via USB cable. The drivers you need are the <b>FTDI Virtual COM Port (VCP)</b>
	drivers. These can be downloaded for free from FTDI:
	</p>

	<h4 class="entry"><a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm">FTDI website</a></h4>
	
	<p>
	<br>
	You will want to get the <b>x86</b> (32-bit) versions - yes, even if you are running a 64-bit OS. If installing on XP get the 2.10.00 drivers under the "No Longer Supported" section 
	(scroll down to the bottom of the page), otherwise download whatever the most recent version for Windows is.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Download the Zip file, extract it to a folder somewhere on your hard-drive, then plug the TCB into an open USB port on your computer. If you do not already have the drivers installed on your computer, 
	Windows will notify you that it has Found New Hardware.
	</p>
	
	<p>	
	How Windows responds at this point depends on your version. It may automatically start searching for drivers, and if so, tell it you will install them yourself "from a specific location" and then browse 
	to the folder where you just saved the FTDI drivers. Windows 10 may not even give you this option. In that case you will want to open Device Manager (if you can't find it just go to the 
	Start Menu - Search, then type in "Device Manager"). Once there look under both the "Ports (COM &amp; LPT)" and "Universal Serial Bus controllers" sections for unrecognized devices, 
	right-click on them and select "Update Driver Software" and then browse to the folder you downloaded.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	FTDI does have installation guides if you get stuck, see: <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm">http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You may find that you need to install the driver twice, once for what Windows will probably call the <b>FT232R USB UART</b>, and a second time for a <b>USB Serial Port</b>. If so, follow the same 
	procedure as before, manually showing Windows the folder where you downloaded the drivers.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When the drivers are installed, Windows may ask you to reboot your computer; if so, you should probably Obey. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Finally, after the drivers are installed, a new COM (communication) port should have been added to your computer. Windows will assign it a name like "COM 5" but the number could be
	anything. One way to confirm whether the driver is working is to open the OP Config program <i>without</i> the TCB connected to the computer. Take a note of the COM ports
	shown in the <b>COM Port List</b> (item #4 on the <a href="formlayout.html">Program Layout</a> diagram). Whatever COM port numbers are listed you know do not belong to the TCB
	because the TCB is unplugged. Now, connect the TCB to your computer with a USB cable. Refresh the COM port list with the <b>COM Refresh</b> button 
	(#3 on the <a href="formlayout.html">Program Layout</a> diagram). Now inspect the list of COM ports - a new number should have been detected, and if so, that will be the COM port that 
	Windows assigned to your TCB. If the list remains the same, then the drivers were not installed correctly.	</p>
	
	<p>
	The other method to identify which COM port Windows has assigned to your device is to go to the <b>Device Manager</b> (From the <b>Start Menu</b>, search for "Device Manager").
	Look for an entry under <b>Ports (COM &amp; LPT)</b> that says <b>USB Serial Port (COM)</b>. Again, the actual COM number will vary. As you plug or unplug devices into your computer, 
	Windows will update the list of COM ports, allowing you to identify which number has been assigned to your TCB.
	</p>

	<p>
	Note also if you own multiple TCBs, Windows will assign different numbers to each one. Windows may also ask you to re-install drivers for each TCB individually. 
	</p>

	<h2>Bluetooth Drivers - for Wireless Connection</h2>
	
	<p>
	Windows already includes the necessary Bluetooth drivers if you use the Open Panzer recommended Bluetooth device, so nothing needs to be installed. 
	See the <a href="http://openpanzer.org/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:tcb:tcbinstall:bluetooth">Open Panzer Wiki - Bluetooth</a> page for more information on the recommended device
	and how to set it up.
