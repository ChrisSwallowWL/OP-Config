	<h1>Reading and Writing Settings on the TCB</h1>

	<p>
	While connected, you can read settings <i>from</i> the TCB using the button with the green arrow pointing down, or you can write settings <i>to</i> the TCB by
	using the button with the blue arrow pointing up. While reading or writing the <b>Progress Bar</b> will
	indicate progress, and when complete, the <b>Info Area</b> will let you know if the operation was successful. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When you first open the OP Config program all the settings you see are initialized to some default values. These probably will not match the settings on your TCB. 
	For that reason, if you just want to modify a few settings on the TCB, it is a good idea to <i><b>read</b></i> them into the OP Config program first, then modify them, 
	and only then <i><b>write</b></i> them back to the device. Whenever you write settings to the TCB any previous settings on the device are completely over-written.<br>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If the <b>Progress Bar</b> halts midway through the operation, and after five or ten seconds has still not resumed, an error has occurred and the operation is not going to complete.
	In that case, click the <b>Connect</b> button (which should now read <b>Disconnect</b>). Then re-connect to the TCB and try again.
