	<h1>Miscellaneous Settings</h1>
	
	<h2 id="lvc">Low Voltage Cutoff</h2>
	<p>
	Low voltage cutoff is a feature to help protect the battery in your model from over-discharge. This can be especially important for lithium-polymer (LiPo) batteries, which can 
	be permanently damaged if their voltage drops too low. With LVC enabled, if pack voltage drops below the level specified all tank movement will be disabled and 
	all lights attached to the TCB, as well as the two onboard red and green LEDs, will begin to blink in a pattern from fast to slow, over and over again.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="entry">Enabled</h4>
	<p>
	Check this to enable LVC. If unchecked, the TCB will continue to operate no matter how low your battery voltage becomes!
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="entry">Cutoff Voltage</h4>
	<p>
	Specify the voltage below which you want vehicle operation to cease. If you are using lithium-polymer batteries (LiPo) a conservative level would be 3.2 volts per
	cell. In other words if you are using a 2S LiPo, a cutoff voltage of 6.4 volts would be reasonable. For NiCad and NiMH batteries 1 volt per cell is a typical cutoff level, 
	so for a standard 6-cell Tamiya or Heng-Long NiCad pack a cutoff voltage of 6.0 volts would be reasonable.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Especially in the case of LiPo batteries, the voltage you measure when the pack is at rest (not powering anything) will be higher than it actually is under load. 
	The TCB measures voltage under load when deciding if the LVC level has been reached. If afterwards you take the battery out and measure the voltage you may find it to be higher
	than the LVC level you specified. That is because once the load was removed the pack's voltage rebounded. But rest assured it actually did reach the cutoff level at some point 
	while the model was moving if the TCB entered cutoff mode. 
	</p>
	
	<h2 id="baud">Baud Rates</h2>
	<p>
	There are 4 serial ports on the TCB. One is dedicated to the USB output and is hardcoded to a baud rate of 115,200. The baud rates for the other three can be adjusted.
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="entry">Serial 1 - Aux</h4>
	<p>
	The Serial 1 (Auxiliary) port can be used for any purpose. It features the full compliment of pins required to connect a Bluetooth module or an FTDI adapter. Another 
	potential use is to connect a serial-capable inertial-measurement-unit. All common baud rates can be selected.
	</p>

	<h4 class="entry">Serial 2 - Serial Motor Controller</h4>
	<p>
	The Serial 2 port is dedicated to communication with serial motor controllers. It has its own 2-pin JST-PH header on the TCB board. It can only transmit serial data, it can
	not read serial input. The default baud rate is 38400 and unless you have a specific reason to change it you should leave it at 38400. Slower rates typically perform worst. The higher rate of 
    115200 is not compatible with all controllers. The Pololu Qiks will work at 115200 however only the "V2" Sabertooth controllers can (this does not include their popular 2x5 which maxes out at 38400). 
    Almost all users will be best served by leaving the rate at 38400. 
	</p>
	
	<h4 class="entry">Serial 3</h4>
	<p>
	The Serial 3 port has the reception and transmission pins routed to two different locations. The reception pin is attached to the RADIO input header and is used to read
	data from serial receivers such as those capable of SBus or iBus transmissions. If a serial receiver is detected, any baud rate setting here will be automatically overwritten 
    with required baud rate for the protocol found (100,000 for SBus, 115,200 for iBus), and transmission out the SER.3 header will be disabled. 
    If no serial receiver is detected (for example, the receiver is PPM instead), the Serial 3 port is available for <i>transmission</i> at whatever baud rate is specified here. 
	Transmission will be out the SER.3 header, which is a 3-pin JST-PH connector that provides the transmission pin as well as +5v and Ground. This header could be used to attach a 
	serial-enabled LCD such as those sold by SparkFun or Adafruit. At present no LCD code is implemented in the TCB firmware, and because the transmission port is disabled 
	when serial receivers are used, this port is of little practical use except to developers.
	</p>
	
	

	<h2 id="debug">Debugging</h2>
	<p>
	If debugging is enabled, the TCB will send informative messages out whichever serial port is selected by Dipswitch #5. If Dipswitch #5 is in the On position, messages will go 
    out the USB port. If it is in the Off position, messages will go out the Serial 1 port (Serial 1 can be used with a Bluetooth adapter). The easiest way to see debugging messages 
    is to use the Snoop feature of OP Config to display them (see the <a href="firmware.html">Firmware</a> tab for more information 
	on snooping). Or if you are developing with the Arduino IDE you can see these messages using the Arduino Serial Monitor. <br>
	<br>
	
  	Debugging is very useful for troubleshooting and is enabled by default. However if your TCB is running as expected and all functionality has been verified, you may want to disable debugging messages
	because they do slow down program operation. The effect is unlikely to be noticeable, but if you are not using the debug feature anyway, go ahead and turn it off.	
	</p>
	


	<h2 id="sabertooth">Sabertooth Baud Rate Tool</h2>
	<p>
	Not all Dimension Engineering controllers operate the same way. Some can automatically detect the baud rate of the master device (in this case the TCB). This includes the 
    popular 2x5 controller which is probably the best suited for 1/16 RC tanks. If you have a 2x5 controller you do not need to do anything with regards to the baud rate and you can skip this section.
    </p>
    
    <p>Most of the other Sabertooth models such as the 2x12, 2x25, and 2x60 must have the baud rate set through special serial commands. This requires a utility such as the one provided here. Once the baud rate has been 
    set appropriately the Sabertooth will remember it, so the utility only needs to be run once. (Note: the Sabertooth 2x32 is a special case and its baud rate must be set with the DEScribe software provided
    by Dimension Engineering). 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    If you own one of the Sabertooth controllers that needs this setup, connect it to the TCB and then connect your TCB to your computer via USB, and finally open a connection to the TCB within OP Config. 
    Select the baud rate you want for the Serial 2 port in the Baud Rates section. Most users should set this to 38400. Now click the "Set" button and the TCB will configure the Sabertooth to use that rate. 
    </p>
    

	<h2 id="pololu">Pololu Qik Configuration</h2>
	<p>
    If you are using a Pololu Qik dual-motor serial controller (either the 2s12v10 or the 2s9v1), a one-time configuration routine may need to be run to configure it for use with the TCB. 
    The default settings used by Pololu from the factory should work fine with the TCB so long as the Qik is used to control the main drive motors. But if you want to use a Pololu Qik 
    controller to drive the turret motors, or if you have a Pololu Qik controller that had its default settings changed, you will need to re-configure it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To configure a Pololu Qik controller, connect it to the TCB's Motor Serial port and provide it with power from a battery. OP Config must also be actively connected to the TCB via USB or Bluetooth, 
    otherwise the configuration buttons will be disabled.
	</p>

    <h4 class="entry">Configure Pololu for Drive Motors</h4>
    <p>
    Click this button to configure the attached Pololu device for use with drive motors. The red LED on the Pololu Qik controller will blink briefly. The Pololu will now respond 
    to drive commands if you have the Drive Motors type set to <b>Pololu Serial ESC</b> on the <a href="motors.html">Motors</a> tab.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="entry">Configure Pololu for Turret Motors</h4>
    <p>
    Click this button to configure the attached Pololu device for use with turret motors. The red LED on the Pololu Qik controller will blink briefly. The Pololu will now respond 
    to turret rotation and barrel elevation commands if you have either of those motor types set to <b>Pololu Serial ESC</b> on the <a href="motors.html">Motors</a> tab.
